# Reinforcement Learning Course Projects and Homework

This repository contains the projects and homework assignments for the Reinforcement Learning course, combining theoretical concepts and practical implementations.

## Homework 1
Focuses on foundational concepts such as Information Theory, Convex Optimization, Markov Chains, Bayesian Statistics, Estimation Theory, and Variational Inference, forming the basis for understanding reinforcement learning.

## Homework 2
Covers Tabular Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) and Approximation Value Methods. Practical tasks include implementing core RL algorithms like Monte Carlo (MC), Temporal Difference (TD), Q-Learning, \( Q$\lambda$ \), SARSA, and Deep Q-Networks (DQN).

## Homework 3
Introduces Policy Gradient methods, with practical implementations of REINFORCE and Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), key algorithms in modern RL.

## Homework 4
Explores advanced topics like Conservative Q-Learning (CQL), Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL), and Bandit Learning. Practical tasks involve Offline RL, Soft Actor-Critic (SAC), and Behavioral Cloning (BC).
